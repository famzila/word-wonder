💾 Lucide Angular Setup Guide for Angular Standalone Apps (pnpm)

Lucide Angular
Angular components and services for Lucide icons that integrate with Angular's dependency injection and component system. Provides both traditional module-based and modern standalone component approaches for maximum flexibility in Angular applications.

What you can accomplish:

Use icons as Angular components with full dependency injection support
Configure icons globally through Angular services and providers
Choose from multiple component selectors (lucide-angular, lucide-icon, i-lucide, span-lucide)
Integrate with Angular's reactive forms and data binding
Build scalable applications with tree-shaken icon bundles and lazy loading support

Installation
pnpm add lucide-angular

How to use
Step 1: Import LucideAngularModule
```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { LucideAngularModule, FileIcon } from 'lucide-angular';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-cmp',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrl: './app.component.scss',
  imports: [LucideAngularModule]
})
export class CMP {
  readonly FileIcon = FileIcon;
}
```

Step 2: Use the icons in templates
Within your templates you may now use one of the following component tags to insert an icon:

```html
<lucide-angular [img]="FileIcon" class="my-icon"></lucide-angular>
<lucide-icon [img]="FileIcon" class="my-icon"></lucide-icon>
<i-lucide [img]="FileIcon" class="my-icon"></i-lucide>
<span-lucide [img]="FileIcon" class="my-icon"></span-lucide>
```
