description: Run accessibility + semantic audit for the current project
---

Perform a full accessibility (WCAG 2.2) and semantic HTML audit of this Angular project. 
Automatically scan all HTML templates under the 'src' folder.

## Audit Instructions

1. Provide a **detailed analysis** of issues found, organized into these categories:
   - Semantic HTML & ARIA usage
   - Keyboard navigation & focus order
   - Screen reader compatibility
   - Color contrast & visual cues (check WCAG 2.2 contrast ratios, avoid color-only indicators)
   - Angular-specific patterns (dynamic rendering, forms, steppers, dialogs, modals)

   For each issue, include:
   - **Context** (where and what element/component)
   - **Risks** (impact on accessibility, which WCAG rule it breaks)
   - **Examples** (file or code snippet if possible)

2. After the analysis, create a section titled:
   ## Accessibility & Semantics Improvement Plan

   - Summarize each issue into **short, actionable tasks** grouped by priority (High / Medium / Low).
   - Format tasks as a **TODO checklist**:
     - [ ] Add aria-current="step" to active stepper element (stepper.html) — High
     - [ ] Verify and adjust disabled button text contrast ratio (navigation.html) — Medium
   - Do not restate analysis. Only output tasks.

## Knowledge Requirements
- If clarification or rule-checking is needed, **consult external sources via Brave MCP or Context7** 
  (e.g., WCAG 2.2 documentation, WAI-ARIA guidelines, or Angular official docs).
- Always prefer **up-to-date official guidance** over assumptions.

## Output Rules
- Entire output must be in **Markdown format** so it can be saved directly as a report.
- The first section is the analysis, the second is the actionable plan.
- Be precise, concise, and implementation-focused in the plan.
