    /* Actually, usually the current word STAYS highlighted. 
     The animation 100% is transparent. 
     If the user wants it to stay highlighted, the CSS should be different.
     Request: "use scale and sunny color whenever a word is hovered or highlighted"
     The animation provided goes back to transparent. 
     However, for a "read along" feature, usually the active word IS highlighted.
     I will tweak the animation to keep the background color if it's the active index, 
     but the provided keyframe ends in transparent. 
     I'll stick to the requested Keyframe exactly for now to satisfy the "strict" requirement,
     but I suspect they might want it to stay highlighted. 
     Actually, let's look at the mockup 1. The word "liked" has a solid background. 
     So the animation might be for the *transition*? 
     Or the user provided animation IS the interaction.
     I will trust the user provided CSS for the animation class.
     BUT, I will also add a static class for "active" if the index persists.
     The current code applies the class based on index match. 
     If index stays matched, animation runs once? 
     Re-applying class triggers animation? 
     In Angular, just changing index changes the class.
     I will stick to the requested code.
